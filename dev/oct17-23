A quick recap of what I worked on, fixed, or learned this week.
I'm trying to keep track of small wins and new things that I pick up week to week.

### Projects & Progress

- Kids Up Seasonal Site

I was reminded this week how important it is to test things properly. I added a feature months ago that I knew probably wouldn’t get used, and maybe that was part of why I didn’t test it as thoroughly as I should have. It worked fine on dev, but once it was finally used in production there were a few issues because it behaved slightly differently. Definitely a reminder that even the “unlikely to be used” stuff needs a proper check from end to end.


- Vision up & general

The company finally decided on a design and gave the go-ahead for a big WordPress project for a client. They basically asked for everything that kids-up.jp does, but with less than two weeks to build it.

At first I thought I’d just be setting things up for a frontend dev to handle, but they ended up being unavailable, so I got the entire thing handed to me. It’s been a lot, but I managed to get the homepage and the base setup for all the individual pages working. I haven’t really used PHP much since university, so it’s been a good stretch and a nice challenge.

The staging site is *wellpeak-dev.great-site.net*. The designs are great, but I found out after finishing the core setup that there aren’t any more designs coming beyond the homepage, so now I’ll be handling the rest myself. It’s a big task for a part-time role, but it’s also a good chance to improve my eye for design and speed up my overall web development process. I’ll spend a bit of extra time polishing everything this week.
