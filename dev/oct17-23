A quick recap of what I worked on, fixed, or learned this week.
I'm trying to keep track of small wins and new things that I pick up week to week.

### Projects & Progress

- Kids Up Seasonal Site

I need to test things more thoroughly.
I added a feature months ago that I knew wouldn't get used, and maybe that was the impetus behind me not really testing thoroughly. It of course had dev tests, but something
functioned slightly differently on prod and therefore when it was finally used there were issues at a fairly critical time.


- Vision up & general

The company finally decided on a design and had confirmation to start a large wordpress app outsourced for a client.
They essentially asked for everything that kids-up.jp does, and gave us <2 weeks to create it.
Initially I thought this would be a nice chance to collaborate, and the expectation I had was that I would set things up for a FE dev to write the pages. Turns out that dev was busy and I was given the task of creating everything.
I worked hard at it and managed to at least produce a homepage and all the functionality for individual page development, despite not really using PHP since university.
wellpeak-dev.great-site.net is the current staging area for it, designs are really cool but after doing the basic functionality I was then informed that there were no more designs being given past the homepage so I'll also be doing that.
It's a lot for a part time job to produce in two weeks, but it's also a good learning opportunity. I personally feel that I lack heavily in my designs and speed of general webpage development so I'll spend a fair bit of extra time this week to polish things off.
