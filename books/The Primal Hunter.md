*by Zogarth*

I have a few Litrpg series that I enjoy, but none have had me craving the next book each time I finish like *The Primal Hunter*. It follows most of the typical tropes...
- Some kind of "system" that integrates earth and people are thrust into some level up world
- Extremely high level beings that try to influence earth
- Extreme power fantasy by way of "grades" f being the lowest level, a or s being the highest

What Makes the Primal Hunter special though isn't just the leveling or power creep, it's the sheer scale. You start with some regular guy hunting deer in a forest, and a few books later he's found himself in the midst of political intrigue involving gods and eldritch horrors. Yet somehow, he manages to stay grounded and be a regular guy trying to min-max his build.

Sometimes I just want something that isn't trying too hard. I want numbers going up, interesting fight scenes, and a universe full of secrets. The Primal Hunter gives me exactly that.
