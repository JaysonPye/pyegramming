- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- 10k killed me today, I may need another rest to avoid runner's knee, it hurts like hell going up stairs atm.
- blog site mostly done, looking good now.
- Needs a projects page, maybe I should host that under jaysonpye.dev instead of pyegramming.jaysonpye.dev, or maybe it should all be under jaysonpye.dev? not sure yet.

## 2025-10-8

## 2025-10-7
- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- Bit of a self note to jot down times I need to do certain things
- 6-9 = care for kid
- 9-10 = Japanese Anki deck
- 10-2 = Most of my work tasks
- 2-3 = Lunch + new anki cards

- Ended up failing my 10k today, bought some new shoes which should hopefully help but runner's knee is coming in red hot.

## 2025-10-6
- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- Learning 11ty in order to place this with some other blog aspects onto a static site I can host on githubIO.
- Approximately 2 hours of Japanese practice today [x][x][x][x]
- Ruby exercises [x][x]
- Some views on my seasonal app are getting insanely convoluted, I managed to work some logic into helpers/concerns recently as it was getting unreadable, but still I'm often asked to add a small thing conditionally to a form that really needs to be done "now" rather than in a few hours.
- Yesterday's run is still wearing on me, "running" it in under a 7minute pace has been the most amazing feeling.
- I think I may have to go for a walk and/or rethink how I'm going to do a 10k run every single day, even the soles of my feet are having troubles.

## 2025-10-6
- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- I've been intermittently re-reading "the rails 7 way" and it's been quite eye opening now that I have more context and knowledge. I'm able to understand concepts and get some little tidbits of important information that may come up in a job interview and understand why it's such a way.
- Another large set of Japanese lessons to complete today [x][x][x][x][x][x][x]
- These 10k runs are breaking my knees, last night I couldn't really complete it so I'm hoping having that bit of rest allows me to set a personal best today.
- I have already lost 2-3 KG in this 6 days so it's working an absolute treat, I find myself just going to bed early now that I'm not drinking, as I'm usually just studying and I tire myself out by 10.

## 2025-10-3
- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- Managed to go through the backlog of bugfixes for work and cross a lot of things off the list.
- The 10k was incredibly painful but I managed to do 11k in 1 go, with a lot of walking on the way back as I'm still hobbled. Feet hurt but my knees don't.
- Huge Japanese session from now until the end of my Japanese class at 9pm. [x][x][x][x][x][x][x]

## 2025-10-2
- [x] Exercise
- [] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- So the night after my first 10k of the month my knees hurt so bad at 1am I went downstairs and had frozen veggie packs on each for a little while.
- Still had a very productive day, but I had to split the 10k into 3 segments and I basically hobbled.

## 2025-10-1
- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- Today marks the start of October, I have large personal goals for october in terms of my personal life.
- The first is that I'm not going to drink any alcohol or eat trash this month.
- The second is that I'm going to run 10km every single day. I'll be tracking this on Strava to share every day. I don't mind if I need to walk a lot of this or even just have an insanely slow pace, but I believe it's good for my mental to stick to this.
- The third is that I'm not going to go back on what I've already been doing really well during September, which in particular is Japanese study and daily coding challenges.

📝 Notes:
- Japanese lesson today [x][x][x][x] 2 hour lesson at night
- Had a fantastic workout
- Ruby exercises [x][x]
- I realized through this ruby basics stuff that I jumped straight into rails and it's helper methods without understanding some of the underlying basics, so it's been absolutely fantastic to go through these on the odin site.
- The wife is a bit sick so I'm also caring for her through the day.

## 2025-09-18

- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- This swap to zed editor has been insane, it's motivated me to code a lot of things in my own time the last couple of days.
- Huge workout today, I've been off and on but when I have done it i've been doing a big one.
- With regards to gym, I'm thinking of starting a running challenge for a month, and seeing if I can build a habit that day.

## 2025-09-16

- [] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- I have been writing partially in neovim for a while, and have been making good use of vim motions, but I felt as though tailoring my dev experience and obsessing over configs was not really the kind of person that I am, I wanted something more out of the box but I didn't really enjoy the vscode experience (its slow)
- Today I've started using Zed editor and I am so pleasantly surprised, it has basically all of the things that I want from vscode, but it feels snappy and fast when I open projects etc.
- This editor basically feels like vim, but with the ease of using vscode.


## 2025-09-12

- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Jobhunt / Client Search

## 2025-09-08

- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- Still really nervous to apply to these mid level Rails developer jobs as I don't feel like I'm good enough, I need to shed some of this insecurity here and just go for them.
- Set up staging site for a wordpress site the company is building, including a CI/CD pipeline for the other front end developer.
- Realized the seasonal site uses a lot of helper methods inside forms and this is causing bugs thruought the app, anything using a form in rails should bind to the model's attributes instead or using virtual accessors in the models, we are using helper methods to prefill names and it causes bugs thruought different form areas that are a huge headache for the admins, (eg, names loading in full names for first and family names).
- Finished a fiction book today and really enjoyed it, it had been a while since I read fiction without an audiobook it was kind of nice to be glued to my kindle with all my spare time.

## 2025-09-05

- [] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- Parenting is so fun, I keep waking up to some crazy mess from my 3 year old and it actually makes my day seeing what kind of trouble he can get into at 5am.
- Added a quick band-aid solution to a project with some hard coded front end things as it was temporary, now that it's looking like a more permanent solution is needed I'm absolutely realizing my folly.
- Merged some old forked repo's ive been maintaining into their own so that my github window looks a little more full.
- Rainy days make me feel lazy, I just want to watch tv or something.



## 2025-09-03

- [x] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- Focusing harder on design choices in rails has become a priority as I've finally started to see jobs popping up in ruby that I feel somewhat qualified for.
- From tomorrow I will start doing some leetcode work in ruby as I feel my simple problem solving work has been replaced with making a million partials to display front end information.
- Planning some more youtube content from this weekend to keep myself going.

## 2025-09-01

- [] Exercise
- [x] Japanese Study
- [] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- Worked on online school stuff last week then it got scrapped, this was disappointing as I was really looking forward to a large scape implementation.
- Creating many japanese email templates and ensuring they dont get sent to trash mail, there are several different emails that we use and a few of them DO get sent to spam, this is really hard to troubleshoot.
- Starting a bunch of tracking things to check my progress moving forward as I've felt stagnant recently.

- [x] IT Self-Study
- [x] Jobhunt / Client Search


📝 Notes:

- Spent time thinking over available jobs in the market and realized I should be hitting SRE applications as I currently do that job in some regards.
- This thought made me think that I should probably also do some AWS certs to pad out my resume a little, as a result I started reading The Side Reliability Workbook, got two chapters in today.
- Hopefully I can make the next two weeks about finishing that and doing Cloud cert practice for AWS.

📝 Notes:
- Finished off a lot of KU work today
- Terrible workout - I need to eat the night before.

- [x] Freelance Work / Client Search

📝 Notes:

- Very honest notes today
- I've been slacking on this Journal as I always come to and from the PC im coding on but don't generally return after 6pm.
- Working with Kanzen Master books for jlpt n2 practice, I will take it in December.
- Many interesting interviews recently, but it is a bit of a let down that most recruiters are mostly interested in my Japanese ability, I recently
had a chat with a recruiter that said something along the lines of "honestly as long as you are generally competent with coding companies just want to
have a good interview and make sure your language abilities fit, they don't really care about your skills."
- A lack of Ruby jobs in the market make me resent the current work I'm doing a little bit, was also told that people see maybe 1 Ruby job pop up each year in Japan.
- My actual JS skills have suffered since i'm working on different things, maybe I need to read some books and leetcode grind in JS.
## 2025/07/28 (Monday)

- [x] 1hr+ programming related textbook study

📝 Notes:

📝 Notes:
- Had an interesting job interview, unfortunately the commute is a little bit too long so it won't work out
- Gym has been fantastic, I'm eating about 1800 calories a day and losing a lot of the weight gained over the last year.
- Freelance has stagnated in terms of using apps etc, I need to find a better way to engage clients.
- Creating a website currently for a bar in Shizuoka, it's good to flex my designer abilities sometimes, doing everything from scratch instead of webpacks is also good for flexing some syntax muscles, and for practicing tailwing v4.

📝 Notes:
- Another break for journalling as I was tracking things in few different places and kept forgetting here.
- Will endeavor to continue in the long term it will be great to see my original thoughts and progress
- Got a lot of work done today, started Bar Blue's website initial designs and setup with tailwind v4
- Exercise has been going great, I feel so motivated hitting the gym each morning, I can activate my body in a way I couldn't a few weeks ago.
- I aim to keep doing gym 5+ times a week for the forseeable future.
- Had some job inquiries recently, but I am re-thinking if I want to work on-site for the rest of my life, hybrid work has been a game changer for my mental well-being
- I did however take a Japanese interview and realised I need to work on this, I can't really speak technically at all in Japanese and that's a horrible hole to have in the IT field.

📝 Notes:
- Went for a short run
- Mostly troubleshooting again for KU work, I feel like 4 hours a day is not a lot of time to work on big things, I really want to just work 8 hours then not work the next, but when I tried it I got so many messages the next day and ended up basically working anyway.
- Rained so I needed to do drop/pick for my kid and do a few house related things, thus my study suffered.

- My kid felt better today so he's at day care and I can get things done.

📝 Notes:
- Kidsup IT: I'm trying my best to fix things the right way with updated tests and analyzing the problem properly before adding quick fixes, as a result I think I'm getting better at recognizing what the correct approach is in a quicker manner.
- Exercise: Run after kidsup work block.
- General: Tried setting just a few tasks, and decided I am not going to have a casual drink at night for a little while, I think I can work more from 8-midnight here and there, but I never do when I have a drink, last night I sat there fixing some hobby stuff from 8pm-1am and I felt so good about it.

📝 Notes:
- Kidsup IT: managed to fix a few big bugs today that were sitting there needing to be done for a while now.
- Study: Got some practice in with nvim stuff, but actually for KidsUP work I've been using vscode and I kind of feel like as I get better at it it might be better for me. We will see as i continue to practice this a little bit.
- Exercise: As I said this will become a priority, I decided that this is the one non excusable thing I need to do every single day, before I moved to Japan fitness was my lifestyle really, my hobby. As I lived far from a gym here and corona happened I kind of fell off the wagon and it's at a point now where I kind of hate myself for it, the journey to healing that starts with making sure I work out daily and can get myself back into that sort of culture.

- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Freelance Work / Client Search

📝 Notes:
- Need to rework how I am doing my schedule, maybe I might move the part time block to the afternoon, it's easier to focus hard when it is paid work so
I think if i can move my study related things to the morning when I am the most motivated that might fit better.
- For today I am doing KU work through the usual 10-2 block.
- Managed to do some good IT study and I am having better discipline with doing TDD development every time rather than taking shortcuts here and there.
There is surely a balance between doing things the 'most optimal way' and speed so I am trying to find that balance, but the end result must be a good product.

- I was in the zone a little bit working through some kids up LMS changes so I just worked way overtime doing it.

📝 Notes:
- Exercise: Back is feeling a bit better which is good, went for a run.
- Study: Decided I should work through Odin stuff for react and js, I feel like my actual just programming skills have worsened, in terms of simple leetcode style problem solving. I spend most of the time figuring out routes and front end stuff lately.

📝 Notes:
Exercise: My back is officially ruined, not sure how it can still be so sore so this might be chair related, trying to fix my posture a little through the day.
Dev work: Decided the best time to practice my new setup is learning new projects, so i'll be continuing that old odin project react course, might help with productivity on github.
Kidsup: designing and implementing bulk billing procedures which is both interesting and kind of scary.

📝 Notes:
- Japanese: Didn't have time to study much which bothers me.
- Exercise: "Back is still ruined from rows, but went for a run!
- Dev work: Been addicted to building up my linux environment lately, but it feels a bit like procrastination as that is taking over actual study, or is this also study?
Also fixed up a few things on an old react site.

📝 Notes:
Already getting inconsistent with these entries which bothers me, it seems if I don't have actual Kids Up work it's hard to think about doing my Journal, I will improve!
Exercise: Really sore from daily workouts so I am having a rest today, maybe i'll run at night.
Kidsup: Remodelling a system I added previously, as I move into using nvim over vscode I am realizing how hard it is to manage my git tree without a visual representation.
Freelance work: It's harder to bring in a bunch of new stuff than I thought, but I definitely haven't been as consistent as I would like.

📝 Notes:
Youtube: I am still considering if I should even be going in this direction, it would be a nice thing to track / check myself but it's also just more work for not a lot of reward.
Wins: Fixed some server crash issues for kids up, which taught me a little more about how to diagnose issues on linux.
JP thoughts: Still not using anki, need to set a daily goal
Exercise: Started using dumbells at home and i'll just do intro lifting until the local gym reopens.

📝 Notes:
Mood: Fantastic, very motivated at the moment.
Wins: I am getting some time to clean up a lot of messy code for kidsup
JP thoughts: I really need to stay consistent with Anki, and to read as a hobby.
IT thoughts: Dual booting linux on my home PC has taught me a lot, going to make the switch to nvim from tomorrow as i've been working on my nvim setup. I chose to go with lazyvim.
Exercise: I've been doing a terrible job on this front as I was waiting for my old gym to reopen to which is hasn't, might start a proper schedule with dumbells at home rather than just aerobic stuff.
